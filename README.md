This repository contains extended code of the machine learning models implemented in our research.

Abstarct: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) presents significant challenges in clinical oncology due to its heterogeneity and high mortality rates. This study aims to leverage clinical data and machine learning (ML) principles to predict key outcomes for HNSCC patients: mortality, relapse-free survival, and freedom from distant metastasis. Utilizing data sourced from the Cancer Imaging Archive, an extensive pipeline was implemented to ensure robust model training and evaluation. Ensemble and individual classifiers, including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, were employed to develop predictive models. The study identified key clinical features influencing HNSCC outcomes and achieved predictive accuracy and ROC-AUC values exceeding 90\% across tasks. Logistic Regression demonstrated strong generalization for distant metastasis predictions, while XGBoost excelled in relapse-free survival, with an ROC-AUC of 94\%. Key clinical features, including tumor stage, nodal status, and treatment type, were identified as critical predictors of patient outcomes. This study underscores the medical impact of using ML-driven insights to refine prognostic accuracy and optimize personalized treatment strategies in HNSCC.
